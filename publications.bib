abstract = {A cooperative routing strategy for daily operations is necessary to maintain the effects of hotspot policing and to reduce crime and disorder. Existing robot patrol routing strategies are not suitable, as they omit the peculiarities and challenges of daily police patrol including minimising the average time lag between two consecutive visits to hotspots, as well as coordinating multiple patrollers and imparting unpredictability to patrol routes. In this research, we propose a set of guidelines for patrol routing strategies to meet the challenges of police patrol. Following these guidelines, we develop an innovative heuristic-based and Bayesian-inspired real-time strategy for cooperative routing police patrols. Using two real-world cases and a benchmark patrol strategy, an online agent-based simulation has been implemented to testify the efficiency, flexibility, scalability, unpredictability, and robustness of the proposed strategy and the usability of the proposed guidelines.},

abstract = {In police planning, a territory is often divided into several patrol districts with balanced workloads, in order to repress crime and provide better police service. Conventionally, in this districting problem, there is insufficient consideration of the impacts of street networks. In this study, we propose a street-network police districting problem (SNPDP) that explicitly uses streets as basic underlying units. This model defines the workload as a combination of different attributes and seeks an efficient and balanced design of districts. We also develop an efficient heuristic to generate high-quality districting plans in an acceptable time. The capability of the algorithm is demonstrated in comparison to an exact linear programming solver on simulated datasets. The SNPDP model is successfully implemented and tested in a case study in London, and the generated police districts have different characteristics that are consistent with the crime risk and land use distribution. Besides, we demonstrate that SNPDP is superior to an aggregation grid-based model regarding the solution quality. This model has the potential to generate street-based districts with balanced workloads for other districting problems, such as school districting and health care districting.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTProviding distributed services on road networks is an essential concern for many applications, such as mail delivery, logistics and police patrolling. Designing effective and balanced routes for these applications is challenging, especially when involving multiple postmen from distinct depots. In this research, we formulate this routing problem as a Min-Max Multiple-Depot Rural Postman Problem (MMMDRPP). To solve this routing problem, we develop an efficient tabu-search-based algorithm and propose three novel lower bounds to evaluate the routes. To demonstrate its practical usefulness, we show how to formulate the route design for police patrolling in London as an MMMDRPP and generate balanced routes using the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm is tested on multiple adapted benchmark problems. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm in generating balanced routes.},

abstract = {The spatio-temporal residual network (ST-ResNet) leverages the power of deep learning (DL) for predicting the volume of citywide spatio-temporal flows. However, this model, neglects the dynamic dependency of the input flows in the temporal dimension, which affects what spatio-temporal features may be captured in the result. This study introduces a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network into the ST-ResNet to form a hybrid integrated-DL model to predict the volumes of citywide spatio-temporal flows (called HIDLST). The new model can dynamically learn the temporal dependency among flows via the feedback connection in the LSTM to improve accurate captures of spatio-temporal features in the flows. We test the HIDLST model by predicting the volumes of citywide taxi flows in Beijing, China. We tune the hyperparameters of the HIDLST model to optimize the prediction accuracy. A comparative study shows that the proposed model consistently outperforms ST-ResNet and several other typical DL-based models on prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we discuss the distribution of prediction errors and the contributions of the different spatio-temporal patterns.},

@article{Zhang2021cities,
abstract = {Cities are continuing to develop and are grappling with uncertainties and difficulties as they do so. It has therefore become essential to understand how urban spatial structure changes, particularly with the increasingly available sources of ‘big data'. However, most studies mainly focus on delineating the spatial structure and its variations. Only a few have investigated the incentives behind the movement dynamics. To identify the urban structure of Greater London and uncover how it co-evolves with socio-economic and spatial policy factors, this study applies network community detection, using smart card data derived from the years 2013, 2015 and 2017, respectively. Our findings show that, firstly, between 2013 and 2017, London's urban structure moved towards a more polycentric and compact pattern. Secondly, it is found that Greater London can be clustered into five communities based on the characteristics of passengers' travel patterns. Thirdly, the dynamics of structural change in different urban clusters differ both in terms of changing intensity and potential motivation. In addition to spatial impact and spatial strategic policies, our results show that employment density and residential densities are also the main indicators that affected the interaction between Londoners in different areas on various levels.},

In this report, hierarchical one-dimensional (1D) architectures involving nanotubes, coiled-coil ropelike structures, nanohelices, and nanoribbons are created via lanthanum-cholate supramolecular self-assembly. These sophisticated self-assemblies are proven to be mediated by temperature. The entanglement of one-dimensional nanostructures is demonstrated to give rise to fascinating "super" hydrogel, which can realize water gelation at extremely low concentration. Unprecedented water gelation behaviors, that is, heating-enhanced stiffness and heating-promoted gelation, are found in lanthanum-cholate supramolecular hydrogel. The driving forces of self-assembled complex nanostructures and the unique role of temperature are also discussed.},

abstract = {We report a facile method to synthesize water-soluble gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using a biosurfactant sodium cholate as reducing reagents and protective groups in aqueous solution at ambient temperature. The diameters (13-70 nm) of uniform AuNPs can be readily adjusted by changing the initial molar ratio of sodium cholate to chloroauric acid (HAuCl 4). Also, the alkaline condition of preparative solution is found to affect the size of as-synthesized AuNPs. This synthetic approach is one-step and "green". The obtained AuNPs exhibit a good electrocatalytic activity toward methanol oxidation. Meanwhile, the AuNPs thin films can serve as an efficient substrate for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Furthermore, platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) are also prepared by reducing sodium tetrachloro platinate hydrate with sodium cholate. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

In this report, photoluminescent lanthanide-organic hybrid nanofibers in hydrogels are fabricated through supramolecular self-assembly, which can serve as functional soft templates to prepare inorganic nanomaterials. By using sol-gel transcription of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), novel lanthanide-doped silica nanotubes are conveniently prepared, in which lanthanide ions are embedded into the silica nanotube walls. In this approach, luminescent lanthanide ions transfer from organic nanofibers into inorganic silica nanotubes. Moreover, different kinds of lanthanide-doped silica nanotubes with tunable photoluminescent emission color can be achieved by changing the doping ions such as Tb3+ and co-doping Tb3+/Eu3+ in the soft template. The lanthanide-doped silica nanotubes are potentially used as nanostructured optical devices and sensors. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

This problem is challenging because stations should satisfy riders' demands for bikes and docks, while these two demands are dynamic in space and time and interrelated. In this paper, we propose a maximal coverage problem for bike stations by incorporating bike and dock demands. We then present an approach for this problem, using the tabu search metaheuristic and agent-based modelling. A case study in Shanghai proves that this model can provide high-quality location solutions.},
